  <span style="display: inline-block; width: 30%">Have you seen multiple people in <b>Lakers Jersys</b> with the number <b>34</b> on them? Have you seen multiple people dressed up in a <b>Shazam</b> costume? Does everyone you meet carry the stench of <b>Icy Hot</b>? Is everyone trying to <b>hide behind tiny things</b>? You may have been whitnessing part of the most recent epidemic: <i>Lack-o-Shaq-phobia.</i> <br></br> Shaquille Rashaun O'Neal (born March 6, 1972), nicknamed "Shaq", is an American retired professional basketball player. He is widely considered one of the greatest players in the history of the National Basketball Association (NBA). At 7 ft 1 in tall and 325 pounds, he was one of the tallest and heaviest players in the history of the NBA. O'Neal played for six teams throughout his 19-year career. <br></br> Following his time at Louisiana State University, O'Neal was drafted by the Orlando Magic with the first overall pick in the 1992 NBA draft. He quickly became one of the best centers in the league, winning Rookie of the Year in 1992–93 and leading his team to the 1995 NBA Finals. After four years with the Magic, O'Neal signed as a free agent with the Los Angeles Lakers. They won three consecutive championships in 2000, 2001, and 2002. Amid tension between O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat in 2004, and his fourth NBA championship followed in 2006. Midway through the 2007–2008 season he was traded to the Phoenix Suns. After a season-and-a-half with the Suns, O'Neal was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2009–10 season.[5] O'Neal played for the Boston Celtics in the 2010–11 season before retiring.</span>
