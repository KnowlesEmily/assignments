        <h3 class="headerz">The Road to Enlightenment</h3>
        <p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, incompatible <abbr class="p" title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>s, broken <abbr class="p" title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>
          support, and abandoned browsers.</p>
        <p>We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of
          folk like the <abbr class="p" title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>, <abbr class="p" title="Web Standards Project">WASP</abbr>, and the major browser creators.</p>
        <p>The <abbr class="p" title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the masters. Begin to see
          with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become one with the
          web.</p>
          <br/>
        <h3 class="headerz">SO WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?
        </h3>
        <p>There is a continuing need to show the power of <abbr class="p" title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. The Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, and encourage
          participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load the
          style sheet into this very page. The <abbr class="p" title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> remains the same, the only thing that has changed is the external
          <abbr class="p" title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> file. Yes, really.</p>
        <p><abbr class="p" title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. The only way this can be
          illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are
          placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have
          contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always push it further.</p>

      <h3 class="headerz">Participation
      </h3>
      <p>Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this page, so strong <abbr class="p" title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> skills are
        necessary too, but the example files are commented well enough that even <abbr class="p" title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> novices can use them as starting
        points. Please see the <span class="blue"><abbr class="po" title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> Resource Guide</span> for advanced tutorials and tips on
        working with <abbr class="p" title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>.</p>
      <p>You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the <abbr class="p" title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. This may seem daunting at first if
        you’ve never worked this way before, but follow the listed links to learn more, and use the sample files as a
        guide.</p>
      <p>Download the sample <span class="blue">HTML</span> and <span class="blue">CSS</span> to work on a copy
        locally. Once you have completed your masterpiece (and please, don’t submit half-finished work) upload your
        <abbr class="p" title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> file to a web server under your control. <span class="blue">Send us a link</span> to an archive of that
        file and all associated assets, and if we choose to use it we will download it and place it on our server.

      <h3 class="headerz">Benefits
      </h3>
      <p>Why participate? For recognition, inspiration, and a resource we can all refer to showing people how amazing
        <abbr class="p" title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> really can be. This site serves as equal parts inspiration for those working on the web today, learning
        tool for those who will be tomorrow, and gallery of future techniques we can all look forward to.

      <h3 class="headerz">REQUIREMENTS</h3>
      <p>Where possible, we would like to see mostly <abbr class="p" title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS 1 & 2</abbr> usage. <abbr class="p" title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS 3 & 4</abbr> should be limited to widely-supported
        elements only, or strong fallbacks should be provided. The <abbr class="p" title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> Zen Garden is about functional, practical <abbr class="p" title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>
        and not the latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only real requirement we
        have is that your <abbr class="p" title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> validates.
      </p>
      <p>Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented <abbr class="p" title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> by now. When sticking to
        the
        guidelines you should see fairly consistent results across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer number of
        user
        agents on the web these days — especially when you factor in mobile — pixel-perfect layouts may not be
        possible
        across every platform. That’s okay, but do test in as many as you can. Your design should work in at least
        IE9+
        and the latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run by over 90% of the population).</p>
      <p>We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright laws. Please keep objectionable material
        to a
        minimum, and try to incorporate unique and interesting visual themes to your work. We’re well past the point
        of
        needing another garden-related design.</p>
      <p>This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain full copyright on your graphics (with
        limited
        exceptions, see <span class="blue">submission guidelines</span>), but we ask you release your <abbr class="p" title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> under a
        Creative Commons license identical to the <span class="blue">one on this site</span> so that others may learn
        from your work.</p>
